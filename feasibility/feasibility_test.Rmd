# Executive Summary 

**Author:** Jacob Scott Zelko

**Date:** 2022-11-02

**Summary:** A feasibility assessment to assess candidacy of partner site location 

# Environment Set-Up 📝

## R and RStudio Requirements

For this feasibility assessment, you will need: 

- **R version 4.2.1**
	- [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.2.1/)
		- [Install R 4.2.1](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.2.1/R-4.2.1-win.exe)
	- [Mac OSX Big Sur](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/base/)
	  	- [Install R 4.2.1](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/base/R-4.2.1-arm64.pkg)
	- [Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/)
	  	- [Install R 4.2.1](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-4.2.1.tar.gz)
- [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

Furthermore, **I am assuming that RStudio is the client being used** for this assessment.
As RStudio can be configured very differently depending on what sort of operating system you are using, please see this [RStudio guide on how to switch the version of R being used in RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486138-Changing-R-versions-for-the-RStudio-Desktop-IDE).

> **NOTE:** If you do not want to manually deal with multiple versions of R on your system, I suggest checking out the great Rust tool, [rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig) which allows you to have multiple R versions on the same machine simultaneously and switch between them seamlessly.

## Copying the `MentalHealthEquity` Project

To download the environment we will use, there are two procedures available:

### Git Command Line Approach

Assuming you have some experience with the fantastic version control tool, [git](https://git-scm.com), and some experience with the command line (whether on Windows, Linux, or OSX) you can follow these steps:

1. Navigate to a directory of your choice
2. Execute the following git command: 
   - `git clone git@github.com:ohdsi-studies/MentalHealthEquity.git`

### Website Approach

For this approach, you will need to: 

1. Go to this [link](https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/MentalHealthEquity)
2. Follow the directions [on downloading a repository without git here](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/downloading-from-github/#:~:text=When%20downloading%20materials%20to%20your,repository%20as%20a%20ZIP%20file.) 
3. Unzip the zip file you downloaded to somewhere you want 

## Configuring R Environment

For this tutorial, you will need the `renv` package installed into your main R environment (for more information about this package, refer to the [Appendix](#appendix)).
This can be done via: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("renv")
```

Then, from within RStudio, navigate to the folder `MentalHealthEquity/feasibility`.
Within that directory, do the following steps within the RStudio console: 

1. Load the RStudio project within the `MentalHealthEquity/feasibility` folder 
2. Load the `renv` package: `library(renv)` 
3. Activate the `renv` environment: `renv::activate()`
4. Restore the needed project packages by running: `renv::restore()` and accepting 

The following code block shows how this would run:

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(renv)

renv::activate()
renv::restore()
```

If everything worked correctly up to this point, you should be prepared to run the feasibility assessment! 🎉🎉🎉

> **NOTE:** For steps 2, 3 and 4, RStudio may have already done or attempted to do this for you. If it did, you may not see anything when you run these steps in the console.

# Running Feasbility Assessment 🤓

## Packages 

The following packages will be loaded to conduct the feasibility assessment:

```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(SqlRender)
library(DatabaseConnector)
```

To learn more about these packages, see the [Appendix](#appendix).

## Defining Connection Details

Here, we need to set-up connection to the OMOP CDM database we will assess.
To do so, we need to define some constants that will be used for the connection.
The following list of constants:

- `dbms` - the database management system that is used to host your database; common options include (see all options [here](http://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/reference/createConnectionDetails.html)):
	- `"postgresql"`
	- `"sql server"`
- `server` - name of the server; could be `localhost`, an address like `123.0.1.5`, etc. 
- `user` - your username to access the server 
- `password` - the password you use to access the server 
- `port` - the port where the database is hosted

Must be defined in this code block (change `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE` when you have set these variables correctly): 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dbms <- "Fill in here"
server <- "Fill in here"
user <- "Fill in here"
password <- "Fill in here"
port <- "Fill in here"
```

An additional step needed is to configure the required driver to connect to the database as follows: 

1. Determine the name of your database management system based on the list [here](http://ohdsi.github.io/DatabaseConnector/reference/downloadJdbcDrivers.html)
2. Download the drivers by running the following:

This is accomplished in the following codeblock (change `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE` when you have set these variables correctly):
	
```{r, eval = FALSE}
pathToDriver = "/location/that/you/want"
downloadJdbcDrivers(dbms = dbms, pathToDriver = pathToDriver, method = "auto")
```

Once this is done, we can create the connection to the database (change `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE` when you have set these variables correctly): 

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
connectionDetails <- createConnectionDetails(dbms=dbms, 
                                             server=server,
                                             user=user,
                                             password=password,
					     port=port
					     pathToDriver=pathToDriver)

connection <- connect(connectionDetails)
```

If there were no errors, then we should be able to continue with the analysis! 👩‍🔬

### Example Connection 

If any of this was confusing, here is an example of how to fill out the above connection information:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dbms <- "postgresql"
server <- "test.data.americus.edu/mimic_omop"
user <- "mimic"
password <- "omoprocks"
port <- 5042

pathToDriver = "utils"
downloadJdbcDrivers(dbms = dbms, pathToDriver = pathToDriver, method = "auto")

connectionDetails <- createConnectionDetails(dbms=dbms, 
                                             server=server,
                                             user=user,
                                             password=password,
					     port=port,
					     pathToDriver=pathToDriver)

connection <- connect(connectionDetails)
```

## Queries 🤔

There are a number of queries to execute that will take varying amounts of time depending on how many patients are in your database and how much data is at your site.

### Person Query

**Desc:** Gets all unique person IDs:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
person_sql <- render(
	'SELECT DISTINCT "PERSON_1"."person_id"
	FROM "person" AS "PERSON_1";'
	) 
person_sql <- translate(sql = person_sql, targetDialect = dbms)

person_ids <- querySql(connection, person_sql)
person_ids <- person_ids$PERSON_ID
```

### Person Race Query

**Desc:** Gets race ID's associated with each person ID passed into this query

```{r, eval = TRUE}
person_race_sql <- render(
		'SELECT
		  "PERSON_1"."person_id",
		  "PERSON_1"."race_concept_id"
		FROM "person" AS "PERSON_1"
		WHERE ("PERSON_1"."person_id" IN (@a));',
		a = person_ids[1:100])
person_race_sql <- translate(sql = person_race_sql, targetDialect = dbms)

person_races <- querySql(connection, person_race_sql)
```

### Person Gender Query

**Desc:** Gets gender ID's associated with each person ID passed into this query

```{r, eval = TRUE}

  "PERSON_2"."person_id",
  (CASE WHEN ("PERSON_2"."age" < 10) THEN \'0 - 9\' WHEN ("PERSON_2"."age" < 20) THEN \'10 - 19\' WHEN ("PERSON_2"."age" < 30) THEN \'20 - 29\' WHEN ("PERSON_2"."age" < 40) THEN \'30 - 39\' WHEN ("PERSON_2"."age" < 50) THEN \'40 - 49\' WHEN ("PERSON_2"."age" < 60) THEN \'50 - 59\' WHEN ("PERSON_2"."age" < 70) THEN \'60 - 69\' WHEN ("PERSON_2"."age" < 80) THEN \'70 - 79\' WHEN ("PERSON_2"."age" < 90) THEN \'80 - 89\' END) AS "age_group"
FROM (
  SELECT
    "PERSON_1"."person_id",
    (2022 - "PERSON_1"."year_of_birth") AS "age"
  FROM "person" AS "PERSON_1"
  WHERE ("PERSON_1"."person_id" IN (@a))
) AS "PERSON_2";',
		a = person_ids)
person_age_groups_sql <- translate(sql = person_age_groups_sql, targetDialect = dbms)

person_age_groups <- querySql(connection, person_age_groups_sql)
```

### Care Site Query

**Desc:** Gets counts of distinct care site types present in database:

SELECT 
     foo.care_site_id,
     care_site.place_of_service_concept_id,
     COUNT(foo.care_site_id) AS "counts"
FROM 
        (
		SELECT DISTINCT
			person_id, care_site_id
		FROM 
                        visit_occurrence
	) foo
FULL OUTER JOIN 
	care_site
ON 
	foo.care_site_id = care_site.care_site_id
GROUP BY 
	foo.care_site_id,
	care_site.place_of_service_concept_id;')
care_sites_sql <- translate(sql = care_sites_sql, targetDialect = dbms)

care_sites <- querySql(connection, care_sites_sql)
```

### State Person Query

  FROM location AS "LOCATION_1"
) AS "LOCATION_2"
JOIN person AS "PERSON_1" ON ("LOCATION_2"."location_id" = "PERSON_1"."location_id")
GROUP BY "LOCATION_2".state;')
location_sql <- translate(sql = location_sql, targetDialect = dbms)

location <- querySql(connection, location_sql)
```

### Visit Type Query 

**Desc:** Count of unique visits across types of visits

	visit_concept_id, 
	COUNT(visit_concept_id) 
FROM (
	SELECT DISTINCT 
		person_id,
		visit_concept_id
	FROM
		visit_occurrence 
	) tmp
GROUP BY 
	visit_concept_id;')
visit_types_sql <- translate(sql = visit_types_sql, targetDialect = dbms)

visit_types <- querySql(connection, visit_types_sql)
```

## Analyses to Conduct ⚗️

### Breakdown by Race, Gender, and Age Group

Here, we look at breakdowns by race, gender, and age group of persons.

#### Aggregation and Privacy Preserving

In this step, person ID's are removed and tables are joined:

```{r, eval = TRUE} 
grouped_df <- full_join(person_genders, person_races, by = c("PERSON_ID" = "PERSON_ID")) %>% 
full_join(person_age_groups, by = c("PERSON_ID" = "PERSON_ID")) %>%
select(-PERSON_ID)
```

Now we enforce aggregation and [HITECH standards](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/hitech-act-enforcement-interim-final-rule/index.html) for filtering:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
grouped_df <- grouped_df %>% 
count(RACE_CONCEPT_ID, AGE_GROUP, GENDER_CONCEPT_ID) %>%
rename(COUNT = "n") %>%
filter(COUNT > 10)
```

#### Recoding 

Using codes that come from [OHDSI Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/), we can recode variables to human readable terms: 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
recoded_df <- grouped_df %>% 
mutate(GENDER_CONCEPT_ID = recode(GENDER_CONCEPT_ID, "8507" = "MALE", "8532" = "FEMALE")) %>% 
mutate(RACE_CONCEPT_ID = recode(RACE_CONCEPT_ID, "0" = "UNKNOWN", "8515" = "ASIAN", "8516" = "BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN", "8527" = "WHITE"))
recoded_df
```

#### Plotting Aggregate Information 

The following are helper functions to plot the results from our aggregation:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
theme_bar <- function(){
      theme_classic(base_size = 10) + 
      theme(plot.title = element_text(vjust = 1, hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 18),
            axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),
            axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14),
            legend.position = "right", 
            legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
            legend.text = element_text(size = 10),
            legend.title.align = 0.5, 
            legend.background = element_rect(color = "black", size = .5),
            strip.text = element_text(size = 10), 
            axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
            axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12))+
      theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "#DAE1E7"),
            panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "#DAE1E7"),
            panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", size = 1, fill = NA),
            axis.line = element_blank())
}

plotRace <- function(df, race){
   race <- enquo(race)
   plot <- df %>% 
      dplyr::filter(RACE_CONCEPT_ID == !!race) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = AGE_GROUP, y = COUNT)) +
      geom_bar(aes(fill = GENDER_CONCEPT_ID), stat = "identity",
               width = .9, position = position_dodge2(width = 0.7, preserve = "single"))+
      theme_bar()+
      labs(x = "Age Group", y = "Patient Count", fill = "Colors", title = paste0("Patient Counts by ",rlang::eval_tidy(race), " Race"))
   return(plot)
}
```

Now we can run the plotting functions to generate findings:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
for (race in unique(recoded_df$RACE_CONCEPT_ID)) {
	plotRace(recoded_df, race) 
	file <- paste0(rlang::eval_tidy(race), "_aggregate_counts.png")
	ggsave(filename = file, path = "plots/aggregates")
}
```

### Breakdown by Care Site 

For this, all we need to do is export the data: 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
write.table(care_sites, file = "data/exp_raw/care_site_breakdown.csv")
```

### Breakdown by Visit Type 

For this, all we need to do is export the data: 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
write.table(visit_types, file = "data/exp_raw/visit_type_breakdown.csv")
```

### Breakdown by State

#### Enforce Privacy 

Here we must enforce [HITECH standards](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/hitech-act-enforcement-interim-final-rule/index.html) for filtering:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
location <- location %>% 
filter(COUNT > 10)
```

#### Export 

Now, all we need to do is export the data: 

```{r, eval = TRUE}
write.table(location, file = "data/exp_raw/location_breakdown.csv")
```
