For this effort, we conduct a federated network research study utilizing claims and EHR data alongside existing survey data. 
Through this analysis, we will develop clinical phenotypes around mental health conditions and build analytics packages to uncover unknown relationships between claims, EHR, and survey data.
This effort could lead health officials to implement better informed interventions that will increase equitable access to mental healthcare across vulnerable populations, supports efforts to decrease acute mental health-related morbidities, and improve the efficacy of health spending.
